            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a collaborative team player with a strong track record of working closely with both global and regional managers to understand their application needs. I ensure these applications are developed and maintained following best practices in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

                With 15 years of experience in logistics and drilling services, I specialize in maintaining and troubleshooting complex electrical and mechanical systems. I also excel in managing logistics operations and using technical drawings to assist technicians in their daily work.
                
                My recent focus has been on low-code solutions like the Power Platform. I've successfully created business applications that have transformed global asset management and improved overall operational efficiency. My proficiency in the Power Platform allows me to quickly develop solutions that drive success for our organization.
